Run python3 parse.py
Should generate two images (also shown when run) saved to input/output.png respectively
Will also generate two output files system_properties_input/output.txt corresponding to file information for particle_input/output.dat
I kinda did part 2 a little bit but I don't really want to write another gui for something that simple tbh.
